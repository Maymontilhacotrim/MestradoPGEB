#### **Supervised classification of Atlantic Forest remnants** :seedling:

This project applies three machine learning algorithms:

- Random Forest (RF)

- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

The objective of this project was to identify the physiognomies of forest remnants in the Atlantic Rainforest. To improve the quality of the models, SMOTE was used for class balancing and accuracy tests to evaluate performance. In addition, the permutation technique was applied to determine the importance of the variables in the classification of each algorithm.  

The code can be easily adapted for different analyses, allowing it to be applied to other environmental areas and studies of patterns in different data sets.

If you need any more improvements, let me know! :smile:
